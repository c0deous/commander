Commander | The command-line based social network
==================================================
This is a project that I did for school. The goal is to get more people interested into the command-line and the more technical side of computers. One of the major things that got people into computers at all were social networks such as facebook. What better way to make the masses more technically literate than a command-line social network?
I wrote and debugged this program in python3 but I'm sure it would work for python 2 as well. Keep in mind that this project is about 50% done but it works well. 
If you don't want to read the documentation you can get started by running 'python3 commander.py -r' to create a commander profile on your local computer. Right now no one else can see your profile because it is on your local machine. My goal is to make a server and client version soon.
